The goal of RFCLUST is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of RFCLUST from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Alar0g/RFCLUST")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
options(repos = c(CRAN = "https://cran.r-project.org"))

install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Alar0g/RFCLUST")
library(RFCLUST)

Z = iris #dataset Iris

rfc <- rfclust(Z,T,10,2,1) # Génération of a forest of 10 trees, for 2 cluster and 1 variables for each tree. With a scaling on your data.

heatmaps <- heat(rfc) #Agregation of the forest + generate a heatmap.

analysis <- analyse(heatmaps[[1]],3,Z) # Analysis of the, eventually, 3 groups resulting from the first heatmap in the data Z.




## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r }
analysis[[2]]
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r ,echo=FALSE}
analysis[[1]]
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
